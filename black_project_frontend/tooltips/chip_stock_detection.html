<strong>Chip Stock Detection Parameters</strong><br><br>

US intelligence could detect a covert project by identifying discrepancies between China's reported AI chip stock and their estimates. Detection probability depends on two factors:<br><br>

<strong>1. Diversion fraction</strong><br>
Larger diversions are easier to detect. Diverting 50% of AI chips would be conspicuous; diverting 5% might remain within estimation error.<br><br>

<strong>2. Estimation precision</strong><br>
If US estimates have wide error bars (e.g., "800K–1.2M H100-equivalents"), small discrepancies are indistinguishable from noise. Precise estimates make even small diversions detectable.<br><br>

<strong>Historical context</strong><br>
Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.<br><br>

<strong>AI chips vs. weapons</strong><br>
AI chips flow through a highly specialized supply chain that may be easier to monitor than weapons programs. We estimate US intelligence error at approximately 7%—roughly half the historical weapons estimate error.<br><br>
