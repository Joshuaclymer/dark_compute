<strong>Chips per Wafer (Yield)</strong><br><br>

TSMC produces approximately 28 usable H100 chips per silicon wafer. This yield figure is from <a href='https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/03/18/news-tsmc-boosts-investment-in-advanced-packaging-with-ntd-500-billion-plan-to-build-six-plants-in-chiayi-science-park/' style='color: #6db4ff;' target='_blank'>TrendForce (March 2024)</a>.<br><br>

This serves as our baseline for converting wafer production to chip counts.
