<strong>Energy Accounting Detection</strong><br><br>

US intelligence could detect covert datacenters by identifying discrepancies between China's total energy consumption and accounted-for energy usage. Detection probability depends on two factors:<br><br>

<strong>1. Covert energy consumption</strong><br>
Covert datacenters consume significant energy. The larger the covert datacenter capacity, the larger the energy discrepancy that must be hidden or explained away.<br><br>

<strong>2. Energy estimation precision</strong><br>
If US estimates of PRC energy consumption have wide error bars, covert datacenter energy usage might be indistinguishable from estimation noise. Precise energy tracking makes large covert operations more detectable.<br><br>

<strong>Historical context</strong><br>
Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.<br><br>

<strong>Energy vs. weapons</strong><br>
Energy consumption can be estimated through satellite imagery of power plants, trade data, and economic modeling. We estimate US intelligence has approximately 7% median error in estimating PRC datacenter energy consumption.<br><br>
