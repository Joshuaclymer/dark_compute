<strong>SME Inventory Detection</strong><br><br>

US intelligence could detect a covert fab by identifying discrepancies between China's declared semiconductor manufacturing equipment and their estimates. Detection probability depends on two factors:<br><br>

<strong>1. Diversion fraction</strong><br>
Large diversions are conspicuous. Diverting 80 of 100 scanners would be obvious; a small fraction might remain within estimation error.<br><br>

<strong>2. Estimation precision</strong><br>
If US estimates have wide error bars (e.g., "50–150 DUV scanners"), small discrepancies are indistinguishable from noise. Precise estimates make even small diversions detectable.<br><br>

<strong>Historical context</strong><br>
Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.<br><br>

<strong>Equipment vs. weapons</strong><br>
China's semiconductor industry is quasi-private with some investor visibility, and the equipment supply chain is extensive. We estimate US intelligence error at approximately 7%—roughly 2x better than for weapons programs.<br><br>
