4,145.86,Calculated from N5 density,"N4P provides a 6% transistor density improvement over N5 (https://pr.tsmc.com/english/news/2874). N5 is 137.6 MTr/mm² (https://www.angstronomics.com/p/the-truth-of-tsmc-5nm), therefore N4 ≈ 137.6 × 1.06 = 145.86 MTr/mm²."
5,137.6,https://www.angstronomics.com/p/the-truth-of-tsmc-5nm,"Plugging in those numbers into the density formula shows the H210g51 of TSMC N5 2-fin achieves a logic density of 137.6 MTr/mm²."
6,106.96,Calculated from N7 density,"N6 offers 18% higher logic density compared to N7 (https://www.anandtech.com/show/14228/tsmc-reveals-6-nm-process-technology-7-nm-with-higher-transistor-density). N7 is 90.64 MTr/mm², therefore N6 ≈ 90.64 × 1.18 = 106.96 MTr/mm²."
7,90.64,https://www.angstronomics.com/p/the-truth-of-tsmc-5nm,"For TSMC's N7 2-fin (H240g57), we get 90.64 MTr/mm²."

28,14.44,Calculated using 2x scaling,"TSMC states 28nm delivers 2x gate density vs 40nm (https://product.statnano.com/product/6777/tsmc-28nm-technology). Assuming gate density scales at same rate as transistor density and working backwards from 16nm (28.88 MTr/mm²) using ~2x scaling per full node: 28nm ≈ 16nm / 2 = 14.44 MTr/mm²."
40,7.22,Calculated using 2x scaling (same method as above),"40nm provides 2x gate density vs 65nm (https://product.statnano.com/product/6778/tsmc-40nm-technology). Using 2x scaling: 40nm = 28nm / 2 = 7.22 MTr/mm²."
65,3.61,Calculated using 2x scaling (same method as above),"65nm had ~2x 90nm's gate density (https://beyond3d.com/content/news/636). Using 2x scaling: 65nm = 40nm / 2 = 3.61 MTr/mm²."
