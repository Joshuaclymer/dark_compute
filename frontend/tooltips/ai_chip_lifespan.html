<strong>AI Chip Lifespan</strong><br><br>

How long do AI chips actually last? There's surprisingly little public data on this. We pieced together estimates from three sources:<br><br>

<strong><a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783' target='_blank' style='color: #6db4ff;'>Meta's Llama 3 Training</a></strong><br>
Meta trained Llama 3 on 16,000 H100s. Over 21 million GPU-hours, they saw 419 unexpected interruptions—but only 3 required someone to physically intervene. Most failures were software, not hardware.<br><br>

This supercomputer ran 4,000 K20X GPUs for 8 years under heavy use. About 97% of them survived the whole period.<br><br>

<strong><a href='https://christian-engelmann.de/publications/ostrouchov20gpu.pdf' target='_blank' style='color: #6db4ff;'>Titan (2012–2018)</a></strong><br>
Cooling matters a lot. Among well-cooled GPUs, 60–90% survived 5 years. Poorly-cooled ones? Only 10–40% made it.
