<strong>Chip Stock Detection Parameters</strong><br><br>

US intelligence could detect a covert compute project by noticing that AI chips are missing from China's reported compute stock. Whether missing chips raise suspicion depends on two factors:<br><br>

<strong>1. How many chips are diverted</strong><br>
If China diverts half its AI chips to a secret project, that's hard to miss. But if only 5% go missing, it might slip under the radar.<br><br>

<strong>2. How precise US estimates are</strong><br>
If the US thinks China has "somewhere between 800K and 1.2M H100-equivalents," a few percent missing won't stand out. But if US intelligence has precise counts, even small discrepancies become obvious.<br><br>

<strong>What does history tell us?</strong><br>
Looking at intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025, the median error is around 15%.<br><br>

<strong>Why AI chips might be easier to track</strong><br>
Unlike most weapons, AI chips are produced by a highly sophisticated supply chain that might be particularly easy to monitor. So we estimate US intelligence error at around 7%—better than the historical average for weapons.<br><br>
