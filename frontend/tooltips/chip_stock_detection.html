<strong>Chip Stock Detection</strong><br><br>
<strong>Method:</strong><br>
US intelligence could detect a covert project by noticing missing AI chips from China's reported compute stock.<br><br>
<strong>Key Factors:</strong><br>
1. <strong>Amount diverted:</strong> Diverting 50% of chips would be obvious, while 5% might go unnoticed.<br>
2. <strong>USG error bars:</strong> If estimates show 800K–1.2M H100-equivalents, a few percent missing wouldn't raise suspicion, but precise counts would reveal discrepancies.<br><br>
<strong>Historical Calibration:</strong><br>
Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960 to 2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.<br><br>

<strong>Adjustment:</strong><br>
AI chips flow through commercial supply chains with export controls providing some visibility. The estimated US intelligence error margin is approximately 7%.<br><br>
