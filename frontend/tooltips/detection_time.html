<strong>Detection Time</strong><br><br>

How long can a secret project stay hidden? It depends heavily on how many people are involved. More workers means more chances for leaks, defections, or surveillance to catch something.<br><br>

We estimated the relationship between the number of workers and detection likelihood using data from 12 covert nuclear weapons programs over the past 50 years, tracking how many "high-context" workers each program employed and how long it took for outsiders to discover it.<br><br>

<strong>The math</strong><br>
We assume detection time follows a Gamma distribution, and the mean time to detection scales inversely with the log of workforce size:<br><br>

μ(N) = A / log₁₀(N)<sup>B</sup><br><br>

The variance is proportional to the mean (variance = σ² × μ), which gives the distribution its heavy tail.<br><br>
