<strong>Energy Efficiency Relative to H100</strong><br><br>

This multiplier captures how energy-efficient China's chips are compared to an H100. A value of 1.0 means they're equally efficient. Lower values mean China's chips use more power for the same compute:<br><br>

• <strong>0.5</strong> means Chinese chips use twice as much energy per unit of compute<br>
• <strong>1.0</strong> means they match H100 efficiency<br>
• <strong>2.0</strong> means they're twice as efficient as H100s<br><br>

We use this to convert H100-equivalent compute into actual power consumption.
