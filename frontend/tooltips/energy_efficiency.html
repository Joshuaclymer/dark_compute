<strong>Energy Efficiency Relative to H100</strong><br><br>
This multiplier represents how energy-efficient PRC compute stock is compared to an H100.<br><br>
• <strong>0.5</strong> = chips use 2x more energy per unit compute than H100<br>
• <strong>1.0</strong> = same efficiency as H100<br>
• <strong>2.0</strong> = chips are 2x more efficient than H100<br><br>
Used to calculate total energy consumption from H100-equivalent compute.
