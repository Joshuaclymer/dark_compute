<strong>Max Energy Proportion Parameters</strong><br><br>
We chose this threshold based on how accurately intelligence agencies have historically estimated weapons stockpiles (see "Predicting the likelihood of detection" section above).<br><br>
Beyond this threshold, the energy consumption would likely be detected through satellite imagery of power infrastructure or anomalies in grid data.
