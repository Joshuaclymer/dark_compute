<strong>Operating Labor and Production</strong><br><br>

How many chips can a fab produce? It depends on two things: how many workers it has and how many lithography scanners. The chart below shows how production scales with workforce:<br><br>

<strong>The production formula</strong><br>
Output is limited by whichever constraint is tighter—labor or scanners:<br><br>

Production = min(24.6 × workers, 1000 × scanners)<br><br>

In other words, each worker can support about 24.6 wafers per month, but each scanner can only process about 1,000 wafers per month. The fab produces whichever number is lower.<br><br>
