<strong>PRC SME Indigenization Parameters</strong><br><br>
<strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>
The global SME market has very few buyers and sellers. Missing equipment would make the PRC an obvious suspect, so a covert fab would need primarily domestic equipment to avoid detection through procurement accounting.<br><br>
These parameters represent the probability of achieving greater than 90% domestic SME sourcing at each process node by the specified year.<br><br>

<strong>Current Status (2025):</strong><br>
The PRC can manufacture 130nm chips with approximately 80% domestic tools. Advanced nodes require imported equipment, especially photolithography scanners.<br><br>
<strong>Projections (by 2031):</strong><br>
• <strong>28nm:</strong> There is approximately a 25% chance of greater than 90% localization, as SMEE and Huawei are developing DUV immersion scanners.<br>
• <strong>14nm:</strong> There is approximately a 10% chance, since this node requires multi-patterning with 28nm scanners.<br>
• <strong>7nm:</strong> There is approximately a 6% chance of achieving this level of localization.<br><br>
<strong>Key Factors:</strong><br>
• U.S. export controls are driving urgency.<br>
• The government has allocated a $47.5B SME fund.<br>
• Aggressive talent recruitment is underway, with salaries up to 3x those offered by ASML.<br><br>
