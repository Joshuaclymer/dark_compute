<strong>PRC SME Indigenization</strong><br><br>

<strong>Relevance to detection</strong><br>
The semiconductor equipment market has few buyers and sellers. Missing equipment from China's declared chip industry would be conspicuous. A covert fab must therefore use primarily domestic equipment to avoid detection through procurement records.<br><br>

These parameters represent the probability that China achieves >90% domestic sourcing for semiconductor manufacturing equipment at each process node by the specified year.<br><br>

<strong>Current status (2025)</strong><br>
China can manufacture 130nm chips using approximately 80% domestic equipment. Advanced nodes still require imports—particularly photolithography scanners.<br><br>

<strong>Projected capabilities by 2031</strong><br>
• <strong>28nm:</strong> ~25% probability of >90% localization. SMEE and Huawei are developing DUV immersion scanners.<br>
• <strong>14nm:</strong> ~10% probability. Requires multi-patterning using 28nm scanners.<br>
• <strong>7nm:</strong> ~6% probability. Requires either EUV or aggressive multi-patterning.<br><br>

<strong>Driving factors</strong><br>
• US export controls have increased urgency for domestic production<br>
• Government commitment of $47.5B specifically to semiconductor equipment<br>
• Aggressive talent recruitment (salaries reaching 3x ASML compensation)<br><br>
