<strong>PRC SME Indigenization</strong><br><br>
<strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>
The global SME market has very few buyers and sellers. Missing equipment would make the PRC an obvious suspect. A covert fab would need primarily domestic equipment to avoid detection through procurement accounting.<br><br>
These parameters represent the probability of >90% domestic SME sourcing at each process node by the specified year.<br><br>

<strong>Current Status (2025):</strong><br>
The PRC can manufacture 130nm chips with ~80% domestic tools. Advanced nodes require imported equipment, especially photolithography scanners.<br><br>
<strong>Projections (by 2031):</strong><br>
• <strong>28nm:</strong> ~25% chance of >90% localization (SMEE and Huawei developing DUV immersion scanners)<br>
• <strong>14nm:</strong> ~10% chance (requires multi-patterning with 28nm scanners)<br>
• <strong>7nm:</strong> ~6% chance<br><br>
<strong>Key Factors:</strong><br>
• U.S. export controls driving urgency<br>
• $47.5B government SME fund<br>
• Aggressive talent recruitment (3x ASML salaries)<br><br>
The main bottleneck is talent, not funding.<br><br>
