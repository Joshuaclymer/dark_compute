<strong>PRC SME Indigenization</strong><br><br>

<strong>Why this matters for secrecy</strong><br>
The semiconductor equipment market has very few buyers and sellers. If China's declared chip industry suddenly had equipment missing, it would be an obvious red flag. So a covert fab would need to use mostly domestic equipment to avoid detection through procurement records.<br><br>

These parameters represent the probability that China achieves >90% domestic sourcing for semiconductor manufacturing equipment at each process node by the specified year.<br><br>

<strong>Where China stands today (2025)</strong><br>
China can manufacture 130nm chips using about 80% domestic tools. But advanced nodes still require imported equipment—especially photolithography scanners, the most critical and hardest-to-replace machines.<br><br>

<strong>What might change by 2031</strong><br>
• <strong>28nm:</strong> About 25% chance of reaching >90% localization. SMEE and Huawei are actively developing DUV immersion scanners.<br>
• <strong>14nm:</strong> About 10% chance. This node requires multi-patterning using 28nm scanners—technically possible but more challenging.<br>
• <strong>7nm:</strong> About 6% chance. This would require either EUV or extremely aggressive multi-patterning.<br><br>

<strong>What's driving progress</strong><br>
• US export controls have made domestic production urgent<br>
• The government has committed $47.5B specifically to semiconductor equipment<br>
• Aggressive talent recruitment, with salaries reaching 3x what ASML pays<br><br>
