<strong>Scanner Production Capacity</strong><br><br>

Photolithography scanners are usually the bottleneck in chip production. These machines pattern circuits onto silicon wafers, and they're extraordinarily complex—each one costs over $100 million.<br><br>

Here's the math: ASML's DUV machines can pattern about 250 wafers per hour, or roughly 180,000 wafers per month. But each chip requires around 80 separate patterning steps, and scanners typically operate at about 50% utilization. That works out to:<br><br>

0.5 × 180,000 / 80 = <strong>~1,000 completed wafers per month per scanner</strong><br><br>

<strong>The production formula</strong><br>
Fab output is limited by whichever constraint binds first—workers or scanners:<br><br>

Production = min(24.6 × workers, 1000 × scanners)
