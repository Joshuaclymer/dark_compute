<strong>Scanner Production Capacity Parameters</strong><br><br>
Photolithography scanners are often the main bottleneck to chip production.<br><br>
ASML's DUV machines can pattern ~250 wafers/hour (180K wafers/month). However, each chip requires ~80 patterning steps and scanners operate at ~50% utilization:<br><br>
0.5 × 180,000 / 80 = <strong>~1,000 completed wafers/month per scanner</strong><br><br>
<strong>Production Function:</strong><br>
Output is the minimum of labor and scanner constraints:<br><br>
Production = min(24.6 × workers, 1000 × scanners)
