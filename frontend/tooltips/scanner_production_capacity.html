<strong>Scanner Production Capacity</strong><br><br>

Photolithography scanners are typically the production bottleneck in chip fabrication. These machines pattern circuits onto silicon wafers and cost over $100 million each.<br><br>

<strong>Capacity calculation</strong><br>
ASML DUV machines pattern approximately 250 wafers per hour (~180,000 wafers/month). With ~80 patterning steps per chip and ~50% utilization:<br><br>

0.5 × 180,000 / 80 = <strong>~1,000 completed wafers per month per scanner</strong><br><br>

<strong>Production formula</strong><br>
Fab output is constrained by the limiting factor—workers or scanners:<br><br>

Production = min(24.6 × workers, 1000 × scanners)
