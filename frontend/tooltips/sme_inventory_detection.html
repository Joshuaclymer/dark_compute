<strong>SME Inventory Detection Parameters</strong><br><br>
<strong>Method:</strong><br>
US intelligence could detect a covert fab by noticing missing equipment from China's domestic semiconductor industry.<br><br>
<strong>Key Factors:</strong><br>
1. <strong>Amount diverted:</strong> Diverting 80 of 100 scanners would be obvious, but a handful might not be noticed.<br>
2. <strong>USG error bars:</strong> If estimates show 50–150 DUV scanners, a dozen missing wouldn't raise suspicion, but precise counts would reveal discrepancies.<br><br>
<strong>Historical Calibration:</strong><br>
Intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960 to 2025 show median errors of approximately 15%.<br><br>

<strong>Adjustment:</strong><br>
China's semiconductor industry may be quasi-private with investor visibility, and the expansive SME industry is difficult to lock down. The estimated US intelligence error margin is approximately 7%, which is 2x smaller than for weapons programs.<br><br>
