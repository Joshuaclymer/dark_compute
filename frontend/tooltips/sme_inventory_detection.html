<strong>SME Inventory Detection</strong><br><br>

US intelligence could detect a covert fab by noticing that semiconductor manufacturing equipment is missing from China's declared chip industry. Whether missing equipment raises suspicion depends on two factors:<br><br>

<strong>1. How much equipment is diverted</strong><br>
If 80 out of 100 scanners disappear, that's obvious. But if only a handful go missing, it might not be noticed.<br><br>

<strong>2. How precise US estimates are</strong><br>
If the US thinks China has "somewhere between 50 and 150 DUV scanners," a dozen missing won't stand out. But if US intelligence has precise counts, even small discrepancies become obvious.<br><br>

<strong>What does history tell us?</strong><br>
Looking at intelligence estimates of weapons counts from 1960–2025, the median error is around 15%.<br><br>

<strong>Why equipment might be easier to track</strong><br>
China's semiconductor industry is quasi-private, with some investor visibility. And the equipment supply chain is sprawling and hard to lock down. We estimate US intelligence error at around 7%—about 2x better than for weapons programs.<br><br>
